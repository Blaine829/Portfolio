## Blaine Broussard's Portfolio




## About me
I am Blaine Broussard, a computer science student at Wofford College. I program mostly in C, C++, and Python, but I am also fluent in HTML/CSS/JavaScript. 



## Projects 

### D&D Encounter Manager. 
Through JavaScript and HTML, this web page allows users to create and remove sprites to represent both allies and enemies. These sprites have user defines elements such as Armor Class, Health, and Allegiance which can be changed dynamically. 
You can view it [here](https://blaine829.github.io/). 

### DFA Interpeter
This program interprets the rules and language of a Deterministic Finite Automata.

Line 1: the states of the DFA (separated by commas, if there is more than one state).

Line 2: the alphabet of the DFA (separated by commas, if there is more than one symbol).

Line 3: the starting state of the DFA.

Line 4: the final/accept states of the DFA (separated by commas, if there is more than one accept state).

Line 5 and onward: the transition rules, where each rule takes the form a,b,c (where being in state a and reading symbol b transitions to new state c).

After the program constructs a DFA, it reads in another file called input.txt, where each line in the file is a string that will run on the DFA.
Both dfa.txt and input.txt should be assumed to be in the same directory as the Python program.
The program simulates each string in input.txt using your DFA, and write the output (accept or reject) into a new file called output.txt (also in the same directory as the Python program, and each result on a new line).
